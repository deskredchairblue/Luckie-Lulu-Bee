# Distributed Audio Processing

## Goal
To distribute CPU-intensive audio tasks (e.g. neural processing, large file transformations) across a cluster of worker nodes.

## Components
- **ClusterManagementController.js**
- **HorizontalScalingController.js**
- **MicroserviceOrchestration.js**
- **DistributedProcessingModel.js**

## Communication
Workers register with a master node. Jobs are dispatched using:
- REST endpoints
- WebSockets
- Redis Pub/Sub (optional)
- Queues (Bull or RabbitMQ)

## Fault Tolerance
- Nodes heartbeat every N seconds
- Master removes stale nodes
- Failed jobs are re-queued or rerouted

## Use Cases
- Live DAW sessions at scale
- Real-time audio transformations
- Parallel processing for mastering and export
