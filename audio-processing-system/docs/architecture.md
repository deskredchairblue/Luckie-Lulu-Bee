# Audio Processing System Architecture

## Overview
This system is a modular, high-performance audio engine built with Node.js and Express. It supports real-time streaming, distributed processing, and neural audio enhancements.

## Core Components
- **Models:** Represent tracks, sessions, effects, users, etc.
- **Controllers:** Manage orchestration of audio logic (playback, effects, visualization).
- **Services:** Handle business logic for streaming, exporting, analysis, AI, etc.
- **Utils:** Contain helpers for math, buffers, performance, logging, etc.
- **APIs:** REST and WebSocket endpoints for interaction.
- **Middleware:** Auth, upload, error handling, and more.

## Workflow
1. Audio file is uploaded or streamed
2. Stream buffer is processed (realtime or async)
3. Processing pipelines (effects, filters, AI) are applied
4. Audio is exported, visualized, or served back to user
