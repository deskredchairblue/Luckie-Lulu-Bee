# Neural Audio Processing

## Goal
To apply AI/ML techniques to enhance, analyze, and transform audio using pre-trained models.

## Capabilities
- **Speech-to-Text (Transcription)**
- **Noise Reduction / Source Separation**
- **Voice Style Transfer**
- **Beat Generation / Music Composition**

## Architecture
- **NeuralProcessingService.js** loads models and handles inference
- Models are run using:
  - ONNX Runtime
  - TensorFlow.js
  - Python-based microservices (optional)
  
## Inference Flow
1. Load model based on config (neural.js)
2. Stream audio data or load from file
3. Preprocess buffer → run inference → postprocess result
4. Return transformed output or metadata

## Deployment
- Convert models to .onnx or compatible format
- Use `scripts/model-conversion.js` for transformation
- Host on GPU-enabled instances for better performance
