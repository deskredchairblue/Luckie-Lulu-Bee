PERFORMANCE TEST PLAN

This folder contains tests to measure throughput, latency, and resource efficiency.

Focus:
- Audio stream chunk processing time
- Neural inference speed
- ExportService duration for large files
- Worker thread load under peak use

Tools:
- Nodeâ€™s built-in performance hooks
- Artillery or k6 (for load testing)
- Custom timers and logs

Each test should:
- Benchmark against baseline
- Track CPU/memory usage
- Help identify bottlenecks
