INTEGRATION TEST PLAN

This folder contains tests that verify cooperation between multiple modules.

Focus:
- Uploading an audio file and parsing metadata
- Real-time WebSocket stream lifecycle
- Full DAW session: start → apply effect → export

Tools:
- Supertest (for API)
- WebSocket client lib
- In-memory MongoDB or Redis (if needed)

Each test should:
- Mimic real user flows
- Validate data handoff across services/controllers
