# Neural Audio Processing Example

This folder showcases how to run AI/ML-based models on audio input
for tasks such as enhancement, separation, or transcription.

Examples may include:
- Running inference using ONNX or TensorFlow.js
- Loading a pre-trained model
- Applying the model to real-time or uploaded audio

Recommended files to add:
- model-loader.js
- inference-engine.js
- enhance-audio-demo.js

Usage:
1. Convert your model to a supported format (see scripts/model-conversion.js)
2. Load the model and initialize the neural engine
3. Pass audio buffers and collect enhanced or analyzed output
