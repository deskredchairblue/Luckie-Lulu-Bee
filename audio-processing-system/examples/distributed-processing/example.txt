# Distributed Processing Example

This folder contains examples that demonstrate how to split audio processing tasks
across multiple worker nodes in a cluster. These examples include:

- Cluster registration and heartbeat logic
- Job distribution and node selection
- Fault tolerance and status monitoring

Recommended files to add:
- cluster-setup.js
- job-dispatcher.js
- heartbeat-monitor.js

Usage:
1. Start multiple mock nodes
2. Register them with ClusterManager
3. Dispatch a simulated workload (e.g., spectral analysis or transcoding)
