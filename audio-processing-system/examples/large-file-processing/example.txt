# Large Audio File Processing

This example shows how to efficiently process large audio files (e.g., 100MB+)
without loading them fully into memory.

Included techniques:
- Streaming file chunks
- Memory-mapped file handling
- Buffer slicing and zero-copy reads

Recommended files to add:
- large-audio-reader.js
- waveform-generator-stream.js
- memory-efficient-processor.js

Usage:
1. Place a large `.wav` or `.mp3` file in the /uploads folder
2. Use Node stream or fs.createReadStream to read and process chunks
3. Pipe data through audio analysis or waveform generation logic
